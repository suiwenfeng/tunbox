## Why Tunbox

In the quest for uncensored internet amidst China's GFW and corporate firewalls, open-source tools like v2fly emerged as a beacon of hope. However, the catch? They're not ready out-of-the-box. You gotta buy a VPS, dive into the config maze, and even then, your VPS might get blacklisted. In short, we need a sleeker, geek-friendly solution that sidesteps these hurdles with style.
